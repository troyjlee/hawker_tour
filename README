Octave code to solve an 18 city travelling salesman problem for 
18 hawker centres in Singapore.  It works by starting with a basic 
linear programming relaxation and adding linear constraints valid for true 
tours until the optimal solution is a true tour.  

The main script is hawkerTour.m. The file cost.m generates a matrix C 
where C(i,j) is the distance in meters between city i and j.  The other 
files are simple auxiliary functions used by hawkerTour.m 

The labeling of the hawker centres is given below.  A google map of the 
locations can be found at bit.ly/zrYEEP
